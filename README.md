# E-commerce-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project
A practical SQL project gaining key business insights from an E-commerce dataset (Customer, Order, Product, Payment, Shipping). Utilizes Window Functions and CTEs to analyze revenue, customer spending patterns, and product performance.

E-commerce Sales Data Analysis using Advanced SQL üõí

This project focuses on a simulated E-commerce sales dataset, demonstrating the proficiency of SQL for business analysis and reporting. The main objective is to extract actionable insights from the data to understand sales performance and identify customer behavior patterns.

üõ†Ô∏è Key SQL Topics & Techniques

This project showcases expertise in the following fundamental and advanced SQL concepts:

- Core Aggregation: Calculating key metrics like Total Revenue (SUM()), Average Order Value (AVG()), and Maximum Price (MAX()).

- Multi-Table JOINs: Effectively joining five different tables (customers, orders, products, payments, and shipping) for comprehensive data analysis.

- Filtering & Grouping: Filtering data for specific timeframes (e.g., March 2025) and utilizing the HAVING clause.

- Window Functions:

- Ranking: Using RANK() OVER to rank customers based on their total spending.

- Running Totals: Displaying the cumulative total of spending per customer, ordered by date.

- Row Numbering: Demonstrating ROW_NUMBER() based on product sales quantity.

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Employing CTEs to simplify complex ranking logic and improve query readability.

üéØ Business Questions Addressed

This SQL file successfully answers critical E-commerce business questions, including:

- Revenue and Customer Base: Identifying total revenue and the count of unique customers.

- Product Performance: Determining the best-selling product and the total orders per product.

- Customer Value: Ranking the highest-spending customers and calculating the total spent per customer.

- Logistics: Counting orders by different delivery statuses (delivered, cancelled, pending).

- Financials: Identifying which payment method generated the highest total revenue.

üåü Option 2: Professional and Results-Oriented

Project Name: SQL Analysis of E-commerce Sales Performance

Short Description:

An in-depth SQL analysis of E-commerce sales data. A practical demonstration using JOINs, CTEs, and Window Functions to derive critical KPIs like customer spending rank, revenue contribution, and order processing metrics.

SQL Analysis of E-commerce Sales Performance üìà
